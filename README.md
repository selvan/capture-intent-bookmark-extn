Capture Intent - Bookmark Extension
====================================

Like many of us, I use bookmark feature of chrome browser, a lot. Over period of time my number of bookmarks have grown in more than thousand. I found it difficult to locate specific bookmarks that I marked them before and also organizing them is total pain. 

Started using Evernote for my bookmark management. Evernote was much better, but I am still finding it difficult to locate content that I clipped before. I started to introspect on "why is it difficult to locate bookmarked/clipped content?".

#### Capturing intent along with content
Most of the time, I clip/bookmark a web page after finding them through google search. But when I clip a web page, my intent (that I expressed as google search query) is getting lost. Evernote clips web page content and misses out my Intent.
Using of tags and comment section of evernote will allow to capture your Intent in some way, but it is manual and not working for me.

This extension, will append google search query (ie, your intent) to title of the web page. So when you clip a webpage using Evernote, your intent is captured along with page content. You can also remove it, if you don't want to.
