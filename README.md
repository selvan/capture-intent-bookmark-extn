Hyper Search Extension
=======================

Like many of us, I use bookmark feature of chrome browser, a lot. Over period of time my number of bookmarks have grown in thousands. I am finding it difficult to locate bookmarks I wanted and also organizing them is total pain. 

Started using Evernote for my bookmark management. Felt that using eventnote is much better solution, but I am still finding it difficult to locate content that I clipped before. I started to introspect on "why is it difficult to locate bookmarked/clipped content?".

#### Capturing intent along with content
Most of the time, I clip/bookmark a web page after finding them through google search. But when I clip a web page, my intent (that I expressed as google search query) is getting lost. Evernote clips web page content and misses out my Intent.
Using of tags and comment section of evernote will allow to capture your Intent in someway, but it is manual and not working for me.

This extension, will append google search query (ie, your intent) to title of the web page. So when you clip a webpage using Evernote, your intent is captured along with page content. You can also remove it, if you don't want to.
